# LX-Streamer

A well-synchornized music streamer, with metadata and blah blah blah

- Far from completed
- Shitty Code
- Unstable AI code and SOF copypasta
- Maybe deprecated other day or tomorrow, since whats the point doing this.
- - (Why not just hang OBS 24/7 and add some few lines of js code to do some json and run a browser capture in OBS which will do the exact same thing)
- - Oh what do you mean we dont have a browser cap on obs linux builds??

Finally lets play frank. I did this purely for curiosity of how vue codes or any other mature dev framework work. You can definitely say thats reflection of the crap daft code before.

    (So why not Flask)
