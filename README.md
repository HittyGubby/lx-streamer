# LX-Streamer

A well-synchornized music streamer, with metadata and blah blah blah

Getting Started Locally:

`No. You won't get any started, since I cannot come up with a single reason you use this piece of code`

`except for mocking HittyGubby and his sucking code? go for it!!1!`

1. clone repository

2. `bun run build` (or npm pnpm npx anything)

3. `bun run index.ts --meta 'YOUR_METADATA_SERVER' --rtc 'YOUR_RTC_STREAM_LINK'`
    
    (Or set env variables: METADATA_SERVER and RTC_SERVER)

Getting Started via deployment services:

`No. But that's since the lx-api won't listen connections on external addresses, though you may always set a port forwarding up or get virtual intranet things, but I CANT BELIEVE SOMEONE JUST DID THIS FOR SUCH AN USELESS PROJECT WHICH ALSO HAVE RARE-SEEN DELICATE DEPENDENCIES AND LAGGY USER EXPERIENCES,`

`so if you actually did that... condolences in advance.`

- ~~Far from completed~~ Completed. And expect nothing to work.
- Shitty Code
- SoF copypasta overdosing
- Maybe deprecated other day or tomorrow, since whats the point doing this.
- - (Why not just hang OBS 24/7 and add some few lines of js code to do some json and run a browser capture in OBS which will do the exact same thing)
- - Oh what do you mean we dont have a browser cap on obs linux builds??

Finally lets play frank. I did this purely for curiosity of how vue codes or any other mature dev framework work. You can definitely say thats reflection of the crap daft code before.

And another thing, I personally wanna build some literally useful frontend services so I can learn some modern frameworks for modern web, like TailwindCSS or something, but I literally failed to take this piece of cake... So if you have some decent idea, just lemme know. (${GITHUB_USER_USERNAME}@gmail.com is enough.)

    (So why not Flask)

STFU.
